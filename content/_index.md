**About**

We are a group of Stanford students excited about humans, AI systems, and what they can learn from each other. We're interested in studying both the human cognitive abilities which AI systems still lack, as well as how we can use AI to better understand or even augment the human brain. We sit together weekly to discuss papers across neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI systems. Here, you can see what we're reading and the notes from our discussions!
